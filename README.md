	- The main RogueSharp library does not use any source code from libtcod, nor does it reference or depend on the libtcod library
	- [libtcod source code](https://bitbucket.org/jice/libtcod/src "libtcod source code")
	- [libtcod license](https://bitbucket.org/jice/libtcod/src/969e7cfdf44c2a8734957306b456ae0eb29ac8c4/LIBTCOD-LICENSE.txt?at=default "libtcod license")
- [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/ "MonoGame")
	- Similar Point and Rectangle classes are included in RogueSharp that are inspired by MonoGame
	- [MonoGame source code](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame "MonoGame")
	- [MonoGame license](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt "MonoGame license")
- [Princeton University Java Algorithms](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/ "Java Algorithms - Princeton University")
	- Several classes from RogueSharps Algorithms namespace are inspired by these Algorithms
